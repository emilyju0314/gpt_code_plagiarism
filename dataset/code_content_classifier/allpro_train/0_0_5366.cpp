To solve this problem, you would need to implement geometry concepts in C++ to calculate the coordinates of the vertices of stars based on the input guidelines.

Here are the steps you could follow:
1. Read the input values for the number of classes and the areas S1 to Sn.
2. Define a function to calculate the coordinates of the vertices of a star based on the given guidelines.
3. Iterate through each class from 1 to n and calculate and output the coordinates of the vertices of the stars.
4. Ensure that the coordinates do not exceed 5000 in absolute value and have a precision of up to 9 decimal places.
5. Make sure to follow the guidelines for angles, areas, and distances between vertices.
6. Output the class integer k followed by the 10 x, y coordinates for each star.

You can start by writing a function to calculate the coordinates of the vertices of a star based on the given input. From there, you can iterate through each class and generate the output accordingly. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with the C++ implementation, please let me know.
