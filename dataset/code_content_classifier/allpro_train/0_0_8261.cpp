This seems like a problem involving dynamic programming or greedy algorithms. Here's a basic outline of how you can approach the problem:

1. Read the input - read the values of m, n, and k, the list of subjects, the time to solve each subject, and the time segments for Valera's actions.
2. Define a structure to store student information (subject, exam day, exam time, and money).
3. Read the information for each student and store it in an array or vector of student structures.
4. Sort the array of student structures in non-decreasing order of the exam time.
5. Implement a function to calculate the maximum profit Valera can get, considering the time constraints.
6. Iterate through the sorted array of student structures and keep track of the available time slots for solving problems.
7. Update the profit and time slots based on the current student's requirements.
8. Return the maximum profit and the order of solving problems.

You can start coding using this approach, and I can help you with any specific questions or issues you encounter along the way.
