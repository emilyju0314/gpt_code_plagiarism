  // Automatic Increment of the Address Pointer for ANGLE, RAW ANGLE and MAGNITUDE Registers
  // These are special registers which suppress the automatic
  // increment of the address pointer on reads, so a re-read of these
  // registers requires no IÂ²C write command to reload the address
  // pointer. This special treatment of the pointer is effective only if
  // the address pointer is set to the high byte of the register.
