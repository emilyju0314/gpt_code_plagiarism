 3

Explanation:

For N = 3, we can set the levels of the passages as follows:

1 2
1 3

If we start from Room 1, pass through the passage with level 1, then pass through the passage with level 2 to reach Room 2, and finally pass through the passage with level 1 to return to Room 1, we have passed through a passage an even number of times. Similarly, for other rooms as well.
