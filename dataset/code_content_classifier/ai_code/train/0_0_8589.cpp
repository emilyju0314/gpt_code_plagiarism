Here is a possible approach to solve this problem:

1. Read the input values n, k, and m.
2. Create an array of size n to store the bitwise AND values.
3. Read m conditions and update the bitwise AND values array accordingly.
4. Define a function to calculate the number of valid arrays recursively. The function should take the parameters of current index, current bitwise AND value, and a flag indicating if the previous number was fixed or not.
5. In the function, try all possible values at the current index based on the condition that the bitwise AND value at the current segment matches the condition provided.
6. Use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid recalculating them.
7. Finally, print the result modulo 998244353.

You can implement this approach using C++. If you need further clarification or assistance with the code implementation, feel free to ask.
