To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the input values for the stability rates lt_lt, lt_rt, lt_lk, lt_rk, rt_lt, rt_rt, rt_lk, rt_rk, lk_lt, lk_rt, lk_lk, lk_rk, rk_lt, rk_rt, rk_lk, rk_rk, L, s0, the musical score s, A, and B.
2. Implement a function to calculate the player's accuracy based on the stability rate and previous accuracy.
3. Implement a function to calculate the probability of clearing the song given the input values and player information.
4. Iterate through each dataset, calculate the probability of clearing the song, and output the result with 10 decimal places.
