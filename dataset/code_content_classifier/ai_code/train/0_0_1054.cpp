To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:
1. Read input values from the user: n, p, M, m, the complaints, radio stations information, and pairs of interfering stations.
2. Create a graph where each station is a node and connect stations that interfere with each other.
3. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to check for any cycles in the graph. If a cycle is found, it means there is no solution, so output -1.
4. If there are no cycles, you can proceed to the next step.
5. Create a vector to store the available signal power options from 1 to M.
6. Iterate through each complaint and check if the signal power from the radio stations fits within the available signal power options. If not, remove that option.
7. Iterate through the pairs of interfering stations. For each pair, check if both stations are selected in the final solution. If so, remove the signal power options that overlap between these stations.
8. After processing all complaints and interfering pairs, if there are still available signal power options, output the number of stations chosen and the signal power used, followed by the indices of selected stations. If there are no options left, output -1.
