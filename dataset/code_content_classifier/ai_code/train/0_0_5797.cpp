Explanation

In this case, $ N = 5 $ and $ S = \\ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\} $. The maps $ f (a_i) = b_i $ are as follows:
$ f (1) = 3 $
$ f (2) = 4 $
$ f (3) = 2 $
$ f (4) = 5 $
$ f (5) = 1 $

Given the condition $ g (f (x)) = h (f (x)) $, we need to check if $ g (x) $ and $ h (x) $ also satisfy this condition. Since all other maps satisfying this condition must be determined from this, we check if $ g (1) = h (1) $ is satisfied or not.

In this case, $ g (f (1)) = h (f (1)) $ becomes $ g (3) = h (3) $. However, as $ h (3) $ is not specified, we cannot determine if $ g (1) = h (1) $ is satisfied or not. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
