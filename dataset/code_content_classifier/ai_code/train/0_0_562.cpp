In this scenario, Heidi needs to ensure that she can make an offer that at least half of the attendees will accept while also allocating at least one brain for herself. The key is to offer a share that is not suboptimal for any zombie.

For N attendees, the minimum number of brains needed in the chest for this to be possible is (N+1)/2. This is because Heidi can offer N/2 brains to the first N/2 zombies, ensuring that at least half of the attendees will accept the offer. This leaves one brain for herself.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition, the smallest number of brains in the chest needed is (N+1)/2.

So, for the given examples:
1. For N = 1, the output would be 1 as (1+1)/2 = 1.
2. For N = 4, the output would be 2 as (4+1)/2 = 2.
